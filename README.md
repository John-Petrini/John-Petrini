My name is John and I work in analytical research and development (AR&D) as a Research Chemist. My experience with chemical data has taught me there are a variety of inefficiencies and unmet needs for the working scientist. I use python to build useful tools for myself and chemists around me. 

Automation of laboratory tasks and computationally driven research and development can save time and effort for the scientist. While I have started this endeavour to benefit myself and the chemists directly around me, I hope they may be of use to you too.
